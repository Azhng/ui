# Button
Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

## Types

### Primary button

Use a primary button to highlight the strongest call to action on a page. They are meant to look heavy in order to direct the user’s attention to the primary action on a page. 

### Secondary button

Use for actions that complement a primary action, or when there are multiple actions of equal weight. 

### Tertiary button

Use as an alternative to the secondary button for complementary actions. They can be used inline because they are different from content in style and recognizable as buttons alongside content.

### Danger button

Use a danger button for destructive actions like deleting. They indicate high severity and are meant to stand out so a user will proceed with caution.

## Formatting

### Anatomy 

**Text only:** Use to clearly describe the action.
**Text + Icon:** Use an icon with text to convey more meaning. Icon can be left or right aligned.
**Icon only:** Use sparingly to save space and never as the primary action. The icon should be easily understood.

### Sizes 

**Default:** Use as the default button size when there is enough space
**Small:** Use small to conserve space or when using button groups (eg. in table rows)

### Alignment

**Fixed:** Fixed buttons are constricted to the size of their contents (eg. text or icons)
**Fluid:** Fluid buttons can take the width of their container 

### Spacing

**Button padding:** 16px padding around buttons
**Button groups:** 8px spacing between buttons in button groups

## Best Practices

### Primary button

• Use to indicate the main action on its own or within a group button set
• Should only appear once per container (not including modal dialogs)
• Not every screen requires a primary button

### Secondary button

• Secondary buttons can be used alongside primary buttons or on their own
• Multiple secondary buttons can be used together as button groups

### Tertiary button

• TBD

### External link

• Set to open in a separate window  
• Can live on its own or within a body of text

### CTA link

• Can live on its own or within a body of text

## Content Guidelines

• Use action verbs or phrases to tell the user what will happen next
• Limit button text to 1 or 2 words
